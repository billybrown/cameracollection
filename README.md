Camera Collection
================

[http://b.illbrown.com/cameracollection](http://b.illbrown.com/cameracollection)

A collection of 100 pixelated camera illustrations for anybody to download and use in whatever way they see fit.

The camera illustrations are under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. This means you can do absolutely anything with them but you gotta give me (Billy Brown) credit somewhere.

I used Adobe Illustrator to make the graphics, Isotope for the layout of the images above and web-fonts Gnoulane and Otari throughout this website. Yay for free things.
